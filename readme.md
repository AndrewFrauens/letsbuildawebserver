## A simple HTTP webserver for static websites

I wanted to learn more about HTTP and decided this was a reasonable idea after seeing https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbaws-part1/

## Progress and goals

* [x] Implement simple echo server
* [ ] Serve a simple hello world page similar to from Rust Book
* [ ] investigate what else needs to be included to be ready for HTTP 1.1
